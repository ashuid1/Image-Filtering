# Image-Filtering
This project will help us to understand how the basic filteration like
1. Brightness handling
2. Warm the image
3. Cool image
4. Crop image
5. Scale image
6. Tranparent image
7. Adding logo to the image will done

All this Kind of Work are done by Just by own function , the basic idea to work on it is just deal with the dimenstion and pixel values of the image which is generated

## Library :
1. Numpy : To convert all dimentions of the image into array because easy to work on the array
2. OpenCV2 : This is very imaportant library because this will help to generate the image on the real time
3. Matplotlib: Used to plting the pixel value for better understanding

## The main task of the image processing is to knoe the pixel value of the each point so use addition apps that will help on this work.
